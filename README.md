# Cartesian-Coordinate-System

# Methods used in Vector2D
> Vector2D.grid()		optional. use it to visualize where your point is. 
> Vector2D.Origin()		origin point(0,0). this function is require before draw points and lines. 
> Vector2D.Points()		return a list which Connect_points() function can use it. And draw points on the graph. 
> Vector2D.Connect_points(list)		connect the points that plot on the graph. NOTE: You cannot directly put coordinate. Pass the list generated by Points() is use to draw lines. 
> Vector2D.getmouse()	wait for user click and return the clicked coordinate. 
> Vector2D.close()		close the window
